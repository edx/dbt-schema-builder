   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

dbt-schema-builder
==================

Automate management of PII redacted schemas for dbt projects on Snowflake.

Setup
-----

See :ref:`getting_started`


Running
-------

Since it piggy-backs on dbt's configuration, Schema Builder must be run from
inside an existing dbt project, see :ref:`getting_started` for more information.

``$ schema_builder build --raw-schemas <source schemas> [--profiles-dir <path
to your dbt profiles.yml>] [--profile <profile name>] [--target <a target from
profiles.yml>]``

Required Parameters

``--raw-schemas`` - a space separated list of source schemas to work on. For
every table in this schema a view will be created in the ``<SCHEMA>`` and
``<SCHEMA_PII>`` schema based on your settings.

``--destination-project`` - the dbt project that will use the generated
sources. Schema Builder will create or overwrite the source file(s) associated
with the schemas passed in to ``--raw-schemas`` for this project. This path
is relative to the source project path (the path that Schema Builder is being
run from).

Options

``--profiles-dir`` - the path to your dbt profiles.yml, defaults to
~/.dbt/profiles.yml

``--profile`` -  the profile name to use from your profiles.yml, defaults to
the "profile" value in ``dbt_project.yml``

``--target`` -  a valid target from your profiles.yml, defaults to the default
target in your chosen profile

If you have you views you do not want to include in your downstream models, add
those that you want to include to a file entitled
``downstream_sources_allow_list.yml``. This file should be placed in the
directory that you run dbt-schema-builder from. Entries should be in the
following format:

``"<SCHEMA>.<TABLE>"``

All others will be omitted when the dbt-schema-builder is run. If you want to
permit all downstream views to be created, do not add this file.
